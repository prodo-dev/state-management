# ~50 State Management Libraries & Frameworks

You can manage your state with React [local state (setState)](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class), [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), but often that's not ideal for complex applications. So far the most common choice for state management there has been Redux, but there are many other alternatives. Inspired by various posts about the state of state management in JavaScript, we decided to compile a thorough list of options and compare them in the categories we care about.

Explanation of columns:

- **GitHub stars** - we're using this as a rough measure of popularity. We know it's not perfect, and it might become out of date with time. We also considered using NPM downloads, GitHub "used by" or watchers, etc., but this was the simplest way to start.
- **TypeScript support** - we care about TypeScript. Most libraries that offer good support for it will mention it in their README or docs, and that's what we looked at to fill this column.
- **Performance** - we didn't run and test performance for all of these, so this is also based on what they say in their documentation. Other people have benchmarked different frameworks, for example [here](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).
- **API Complexity** - the APIs vary from simple and easy to learn, to complex and full of boilerplate. At the moment this field will often link to the API documentation that you can check for yourself, but we are working on filling it in more directly.
- **Abstract Concepts** - this is a list of concepts you'll need to learn to use this framework.
- **Extensibility** - how easy is it to customize and extend the framework with either middleware, plugins or otherwise?
- **Devtools** - does the framework come with its own developer tools, loggers, or integrate with existing (usually Redux) developer tools?
- **Time travel** - do the devtools offer time travel functionality? If you're not familiar with this, you can check the Redux example [here](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/time-travel-in-react-redux-apps-using-the-redux-devtools-5e94eba5e7c0)).

This table is roughly ordered by number of GitHub stars, but we’ve also grouped some related libraries together, for example different MobX variations.

## Contributions

There's a lot of information to keep track of here, so it's entirely possible we got something wrong, or it went out of date. If you spot a mistake, or want to add a new entry to the table, please make a PR! We welcome comments and suggestions.

## Comparison Table

Compiled in October 2019. A version of this page with a table you can filter is [here](https://prodo-dev.github.io/state-management/).
